Description: Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata. It supports ASF,
        FLAC, M4A, Monkey's Audio, MP3, Musepack, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Speex, Ogg
        Theora, Ogg Vorbis, True Audio, WavPack and OptimFROG audio files. All
        versions of ID3v2 are supported, and all standard ID3v2.4 frames are
        parsed. It can read Xing headers to accurately calculate the bitrate
        and length of MP3s. ID3 and APEv2 tags can be edited regardless of
        audio format. It can also manipulate Ogg streams on an individual
        packet/page level.

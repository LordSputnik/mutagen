SYNOPSIS
========

**mid3v2** [*options*] *filename* ...


DESCRIPTION
===========

mid3v2 is a Mutagen-based replacement for id3lib's **id3v2**. It supports
ID3v2.4 and more frames; it also does not have the numerous bugs that
plague **id3v2**.

This program exists mostly for compatibility with programs that want
to tag files using **id3v2**. For a more usable interface, we recommend Ex
Falso.


OPTIONS
=======

-q, --quiet
    Be quiet: do not mention file operations that perform the user's
    request. Warnings will still be printed.

-v, --verbose
    Be verbose: state all operations performed. This is the opposite of
    --quiet. This is the default.

-e, --escape
    Enable interpretation of backslash escapes for tag values.
    Makes it possible to escape the colon-separator in TXXX, COMM
    values like '\\:' and insert escape sequences like '\\n', '\\t' etc.

-f, --list-frames
    Display all supported ID3v2.3/2.4 frames and their meanings.

-L, --list-genres
    List all ID3v1 numeric genres. These can be used to set TCON frames,
    but it is not recommended.

-l, --list
    List all tags in the files. The output format is *not* the same as
    **id3v2**'s; instead, it is easily parsable and readable. Some tags may not
    have human-readable representations.

--list-raw
    List all tags in the files, in raw format. Although this format is
    nominally human-readable, it may be very long if the tag contains
    embedded binary data.

-d, --delete-v2
    Delete ID3v2 tags.

-s, --delete-v1
    Delete ID3v1 tags.

-D, --delete-all
    Delete all ID3 tags.

--delete-frames=FID1,FID2,...
    Delete specific ID3v2 frames (or groups of frames) from the files.

-C, --convert
    Convert ID3v1 tags to ID3v2 tags. This  will also happen automatically
    during any editing.

-a, --artist\=artist
    Set the artist information (TPE1).

-A, --album\=album
    Set the album information (TALB).

-t, --song\=title
    Set the title information (TIT2).

-c, --comment=DESCRIPTION:COMMENT:LANGUAGE
    Set a comment (COMM). The language and description may be omitted, in
    which case the language defaults to English, and the description to an
    empty string.

-g, --genre\=genre
    Set the genre information (TCON).

-y, --year=, --date=YYYY-[MM-DD]
    Set the year/date information (TDRC).

-Tnum/num, --track=num/num
    Set the track number (TRCK).

Any text or URL frame (those beginning with T or W) can be modified or
added by prefixing the name of the frame with "--". For example, **--TIT3
"Monkey!"** will set the TIT3 (subtitle) frame to **Monkey!**.

The TXXX frame requires a colon-separated description key; many TXXX frames
may be set in the file as long as they have different keys. To set this
key, just separate the text with a colon, e.g. **--TXXX
"ALBUMARTISTSORT:Examples, The"**.

The special POPM frame can be set in a similar way: **--POPM
"bob@example.com:128:2"** to set Bob's rating to 128/255 with 2 plays.


BUGS
====

No sanity checking is done on the editing operations you perform, so mid3v2
will happily accept --TSIZ when editing an ID3v2.4 frame. However, it will
also automatically throw it out during the next edit operation.

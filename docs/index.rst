Mutagen Documentation
=====================

.. note::

    This documentation is still incomplete and it's recommended to read the
    `source <https://bitbucket.org/lazka/mutagen/src/default/mutagen>`__
    for the full details.

What is Mutagen?
----------------

Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata. It supports ASF, FLAC, 
M4A, Monkey's Audio, MP3, Musepack, Ogg Opus, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Speex, Ogg 
Theora, Ogg Vorbis, True Audio, WavPack, OptimFROG, and AIFF audio files. 
All  versions of ID3v2 are supported, and all standard ID3v2.4 frames are 
parsed. It can read Xing headers to accurately calculate the bitrate and 
length of MP3s. ID3 and APEv2 tags can be edited regardless of audio 
format. It can also manipulate Ogg streams on an individual packet/page 
level.

Mutagen works on Python 2.6+ / PyPy and has no dependencies outside the
CPython standard library.

There is a :doc:`brief tutorial with several API examples.

Where do I get it?
------------------

Mutagen is hosted on `Bitbucket <http://bitbucket.org/lazka/mutagen>`_. The 
`download page <https://bitbucket.org/lazka/mutagen/downloads>`_ will have the 
latest version or check out the Mercurial repository::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/lazka/mutagen

Why Mutagen?
------------

Quod Libet has more strenuous requirements in a tagging library than most 
programs that deal with tags. Furthermore, most tagging libraries suck. 
Therefore we felt it was necessary to write our own.

* Mutagen has a simple API, that is roughly the same across all tag formats
  and versions and integrates into Python's builtin types and interfaces.
* New frame types and file formats are easily added, and the behavior of the
  current formats can be changed by extending them.
* Freeform keys, multiple values, Unicode, and other advanced features were
  considered from the start and are fully supported.
* All ID3v2 versions and all ID3v2.4 frames are covered, including rare ones
  like POPM or RVA2.
* We take automated testing very seriously. All bug fixes are commited with a
  test that prevents them from recurring, and new features are committed with
  a full test suite. 

Real World Use
--------------

Mutagen can load nearly every MP3 we have thrown at it (when it hasn't, we 
make it do so). Scripts are included so you can run the same tests on your 
collection.

The following software projects are using Mutagen for tagging:

* `Ex Falso and Quod Libet <http://code.google.com/p/quodlibet/>`_, a flexible tagger and player
* `Beets <http://beets.radbox.org/>`_, a music library manager and MusicBrainz tagger
* `Picard <http://musicbrainz.org/doc/PicardQt>`_, cross-platform MusicBrainz tagger
* `Puddletag <http://puddletag.sourceforge.net/>`_, an audio tag editor
* `Listen <http://listengnome.free.fr/>`_, a music player for GNOME
* `Exaile <http://www.exaile.org/>`_, a media player aiming to be similar to KDE's AmaroK, but for GTK+
* `ZOMG <http://zomg.alioth.debian.org/>`_, a command-line player for ZSH
* `pytagsfs <http://www.pytagsfs.org/>`_, virtual file system for organizing media files by metadata
* Debian's version of `JACK <http://jack.sourceforge.net/>`_, an audio CD ripper, uses Mutagen to tag FLACs
* Amarok's replaygain `script <http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=26073>`_

For historical and practical reasons, Mutagen shares a `mailing list 
<http://groups.google.com/group/quod-libet-development/>`_ and IRC channel 
(#quodlibet on irc.oftc.net) with Quod Libet. If you need help using Mutagen 
or would like to discuss the library, please use the mailing list. Bugs and 
patches should go to the `issue tracker 
<https://bitbucket.org/lazka/mutagen/issues>`_.

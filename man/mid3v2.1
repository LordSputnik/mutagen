.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmid3v2\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIfilename\fP ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
mid3v2 is a Mutagen\-based replacement for id3lib\(aqs \fBid3v2\fP. It supports
ID3v2.4 and more frames; it also does not have the numerous bugs that
plague \fBid3v2\fP.
.sp
This program exists mostly for compatibility with programs that want
to tag files using \fBid3v2\fP. For a more usable interface, we recommend Ex
Falso.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q,  \-\-quiet
Be quiet: do not mention file operations that perform the user\(aqs
request. Warnings will still be printed.
.TP
.B \-v,  \-\-verbose
Be verbose: state all operations performed. This is the opposite of
\-\-quiet. This is the default.
.TP
.B \-e,  \-\-escape
Enable interpretation of backslash escapes for tag values.
Makes it possible to escape the colon\-separator in TXXX, COMM
values like \(aq\e:\(aq and insert escape sequences like \(aq\en\(aq, \(aq\et\(aq etc.
.TP
.B \-f,  \-\-list\-frames
Display all supported ID3v2.3/2.4 frames and their meanings.
.TP
.B \-L,  \-\-list\-genres
List all ID3v1 numeric genres. These can be used to set TCON frames,
but it is not recommended.
.TP
.B \-l,  \-\-list
List all tags in the files. The output format is \fInot\fP the same as
\fBid3v2\fP\(aqs; instead, it is easily parsable and readable. Some tags may not
have human\-readable representations.
.TP
.B \-\-list\-raw
List all tags in the files, in raw format. Although this format is
nominally human\-readable, it may be very long if the tag contains
embedded binary data.
.TP
.B \-d,  \-\-delete\-v2
Delete ID3v2 tags.
.TP
.B \-s,  \-\-delete\-v1
Delete ID3v1 tags.
.TP
.B \-D,  \-\-delete\-all
Delete all ID3 tags.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-delete\-frames=FID1,FID2,...
Delete specific ID3v2 frames (or groups of frames) from the files.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C,  \-\-convert
Convert ID3v1 tags to ID3v2 tags. This  will also happen automatically
during any editing.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-artist=artist
Set the artist information (TPE1).
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-album=album
Set the album information (TALB).
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-song=title
Set the title information (TIT2).
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-comment=DESCRIPTION:COMMENT:LANGUAGE
Set a comment (COMM). The language and description may be omitted, in
which case the language defaults to English, and the description to an
empty string.
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-genre=genre
Set the genre information (TCON).
.TP
.B \-y, \-\-year=, \-\-date=YYYY\-[MM\-DD]
Set the year/date information (TDRC).
.TP
.B \-Tnum/num, \-\-track=num/num
Set the track number (TRCK).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any text or URL frame (those beginning with T or W) can be modified or
added by prefixing the name of the frame with "\-\-". For example, \fB\-\-TIT3
"Monkey!"\fP will set the TIT3 (subtitle) frame to \fBMonkey!\fP.
.sp
The TXXX frame requires a colon\-separated description key; many TXXX frames
may be set in the file as long as they have different keys. To set this
key, just separate the text with a colon, e.g. \fB\-\-TXXX
"ALBUMARTISTSORT:Examples, The"\fP.
.sp
The special POPM frame can be set in a similar way: \fB\-\-POPM
"bob@example.com:128:2"\fP to set Bob\(aqs rating to 128/255 with 2 plays.
.SH BUGS
.sp
No sanity checking is done on the editing operations you perform, so mid3v2
will happily accept \-\-TSIZ when editing an ID3v2.4 frame. However, it will
also automatically throw it out during the next edit operation.
